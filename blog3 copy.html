                <p class="card-text">Blood donations play an irreplaceable role in people's lives, however; it is sometimes opposed by myths. Let's dispel some common myths:Let's dispel some common myths:


                  Myth: Blood donation is a bitter-sweet process, for it is painful and risky.
                  
                  Fact: Painless and risk free, this procedure though is likely to be associated with a feeling of discomfort during needle insertion. Strict measures ensure that the donors and recipients can be safe with the screening process.
                  
                  
                  Myth: A medical condition or a drug may stop an otherwise suitable donor.
                  
                  Fact: Sometimes, diseases or medications that the person has, is not an obstacle for organ donation. Ask the advice of the healthcare specialists or blood banks to get the direction.
                  
                  
                  Myth: Age affects the quality of donation and determines eligibility.
                  
                  Fact: Regardless of the age- the donor isn't disqualified by the fact. Requirements may differ, but typically agreed lanes will accept donors when they are 16 or 17 years old with parental consent and occasionally without having an upper age limit.
                  
                  
                  Myth: A person cannot donate a blood that will cure the whole World.
                  
                  Fact: The body recovers donated blood in a weeks to a month. All are in donor health status, and, donating usually damages their health, too.
                  
                  
                  Myth: Donation is tedious and impractical as it takes time and effort.
                  
                  Fact: This is much faster than actual blood donation, which can take between 30 minutes and an hour. The center provides flexible operating hours as well as mobile units during evenings or weekends for the working adults and students convenience.
                  
                  
                  These rumors can be a barrier to people who wish to donate blood or who need this precious commodity, always remember that whenever there is the need, the blood bank is never low. Acknowledging the truths behind blood donation, in particular, enhances the understanding of the subject and hence the need for people to participate in this vital act of altruism.</p>
