                <p class="card-text">Some people make the decision to give blood because it is so important for them to help others. A part of them to lead a fulfilled life is to give. To illustrate, lets take Sarah as the example who ended up donating blood after and her mother battled leukemia. When her mother was beneficiary of a blood infusion Sarah was witness to the life saving impact and was compelled to be one of her regular donors as she played a crucial role in someone else's life survival.


                  Mark, a first-time donor, conquered his fear of needles and donated out of respect to his friend who was involved in a car accident which he hardly survived. When favoring overcoming his fears, the prospect of possibly saving somebody's life encouraged him to come up with a decision to donate the blood, which he describes as an empowering and rewarding moment.
                  
                  
                  The recipients themselves are the beneficiaries on the other side of the spectrum who have been given a new lease at life due to the generosity of their donors. Emilia, an adolescent who got diagnosed with a severe amount of anemia during the aaaah, remembers the greatly relieving combined emotions while being given a blood transfusion that allowed her to clasp her newly born son and hold him for his first time.
                  
                  
                  In the same fashion, John, a person who overcame cancer and lived through severe chemotherapy, such donors, whose blood had been a source of strength for him when he was at his most debilitated and at a loss, gave him reason to hope and prop up his drive to endure.
                  
                  
                  In every case, one can discover that the real link is the remarkable force that is experiencedâ€”not only by donors but also by future receivers. And it's a reflection of amazing ability in human compassion and the wave of the kindness that span across space outside the room the hospital. This endeavor falls in line with my journey toward promoting the importance of giving blood. It is amazing that the small deed of giving blood has the impact of bonding me with other people on a journey to healing, hope and humanity.</p>
