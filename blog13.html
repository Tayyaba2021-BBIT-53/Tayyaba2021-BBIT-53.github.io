                <p class="card-text">Giving blood is usually a resounding homage to the lifesaver who provides those vital components which are not always available from pharmaceutical companies. Apart from its own, altruism influences the way for the others to become more compassionate and improving the relationships among people. Blood donations are at the foundation of public health maintaining a broad society impact going forward. It impacts communities on various levels.


                  However, the main advantage of this type of donation is that it contributes immensely to the availability of blood for treatment of various medical conditions. Medical procedures such as surgeries, cancer treatment, and anemia treatment among others (other chronic diseases) require blood for them to be more successful. Emergency response, natural disaster, and other emergency situations may not always allow proper time to dramatically increase blood supplies; blood drive is an excellent solution to mitigate these risks, as their emergency donation reserves will help provide numerous people with the health and safety needed.
                  
                  
                  What is more, the process of donating blood accomplishes the same purpose namely that the donors, who are required to have their blood screened, are provided with an opportunity of screening their health every once in a while. It does not only foster individual health styles but also causes early recognition and detection of some health conditions, which consequently helps early lifesaving treatments and reduces the burdening order of our healthcare systems.
                  
                  
                  The process of donation on a long term picture, brings a culture of community and concern, as well as an interconnection within the society. It unites the members who have numerous different backgrounds around a purpose, thereby reduces the people rift that might have otherwise happened and fosters empathy. Also, the blood donation events usually include a program that is conducive to maintaining good health and thwarts on the expression of the diseases, in addition promotes voluntary works to the society.
                  
                  
                  To wrap it up, the influence of blood donation especially through availability of medical resources cannot be ignored because it involves provision of essential medical supplies up to community development and resilience. Through the act of recognizing the importance of the blood donation, we will not only be saving lives but will also create the fabric of our society, as we will be doing every donation after another.</p>
