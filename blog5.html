                  1. Take a glass full to drink water and do not forget to intake a nourishing meal before any blood donation. Observing appropriate fluid supply and nutritional intake before and after the act of donation keeps the blood volume in normal range and thereby reduces the dizziness and feeling lightheaded during the procedures.
                  
                  
                  2. Make sure you get plenty of rest before your donation time as this could help improve your blood compounds. Find of solid sleep can work wonders as it makes you feel more relaxed and also comfortable during the donation process.
                  
                  
                  3. In the most blood donation centers, you have to provide a valid form of ID that needs to be like a driver's license or a passport so that they can verify your identity. Since the donor ID will not be provided to you at the time of the appointment, ensure to have it on you before going to the donation center.
                  
                  
                  4. Opt for rounded-up, free-flowing outfits and sleeves that are harder to unbutton. This will, therefore, simplify the actions of any healthcare professional for simple grasping of your arm.

                  6.When you are made ready for the process, be as peaceful and steady as you can manage. Let your breath be deep and paused for a minute to think about the greater good your contribution will bring.
                  
                  
                  7. Immediately after the blood donation, drink plenty of fluids and do not engage in activities that may require a high level of energy for the rest of the day. These measures will restore water content lost in sweating to evade dehydration.
